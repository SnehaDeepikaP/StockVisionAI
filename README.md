# StockVision AI - Agentic Retail Optimization Platform

**StockVision AI** is an AI-powered agentic platform designed to optimize retail operations, including **demand forecasting**, **inventory monitoring**, and **pricing strategies**. Using a multi-agent architecture and powered by Ollama's LLaMA 3.2 model, StockVision AI enables retailers to make data-driven decisions by forecasting demand, adjusting stock levels, and optimizing prices based on historical trends and competition.

## Features

- 🧠 **Multi-Agent System**:
  - **Demand Forecasting Agent**: Predicts future product demand using historical sales data.
  - **Inventory Monitoring Agent**: Tracks stock levels, detects low stock or overstock situations, and suggests reorder actions.
  - **Pricing Optimization Agent**: Adjusts product pricing based on competitor analysis, elasticity, and sales volume.

- 📊 **Real-Time Dashboards**:
  - Visualize demand forecasts, stock levels, and pricing optimization strategies through interactive charts.

- 🧠 **LLM-Powered Reasoning**:
  - Uses **locally hosted LLaMA 3.2 via Ollama** for intelligent, real-time decision-making.

- 🔄 **Custom Dataset Upload**:
  - Upload CSVs for demand, inventory, and pricing data to tailor the predictions and optimizations.

- 📈 **Interactive Chat Interface**:
  - Chat with the system to ask about stock levels, forecasted demand, and optimized pricing.

- 🛠 **Responsible AI**:
  - Transparent decision-making, with clear reasoning paths and human-in-the-loop control.

- 🧠 **Flexible Integration**:
  - Compatible with external data sources or APIs for seamless integration into existing retail systems.
